The price of a cosmetic product is not necessarily dependent on the number of allergens it contains.

Other factors, such as the quality of ingredients, brand reputation, and packaging, can also affect the price of a cosmetic product. 

However, some companies may use higher-quality, hypoallergenic ingredients and charge a premium for their products as a result. Ultimately, it's important to carefully read the ingredient labels and choose products that work for your skin type and personal preferences, regardless of the price."""
