Some manufacturers may not disclose the complete list of ingredients on the product label, making it difficult to identify potential allergens.


2. Varying individual reactions: Allergic reactions are highly individual, and a substance that causes a reaction in one person may not cause the same reaction in another. This makes it challenging to determine whether a specific ingredient is an allergen for everyone.


3. Complex chemical compositions: Many cosmetic products have complex chemical compositions, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact allergen responsible for an adverse reaction.


4. Allergen thresholds: Some individuals may only experience an allergic reaction when exposed to a certain amount of an allergen. Identifying the exact threshold for each person can be challenging.



5. Lack of standardized testing: There is no universally accepted method for testing cosmetic products for allergens, making it difficult to compare the allergenic potential of different products.


6. Changes in product formulations: Manufacturers may change product formulations over time, introducing new allergens or increasing the concentration of existing allergens. This makes it difficult to maintain up-to-date information about the allergenic potential of specific products.


7. Regulatory differences: Different countries have different regulations regarding allergens and ingredient labeling, leading to inconsistencies in the information available to consumers.


Despite these limitations, being aware of the most common allergens and carefully reading ingredient labels can help individuals with sensitive skin or a history of allergies make informed decisions when choosing cosmetic products.
